# SDT

A concept repeated over and over, which I could not agree more with - The important of lifestyle in the development and treatment of respiratory conditions.

Both from a scientific and an intuition perspective, the way a person spends the majority of their days is key in determining the course of their long term outcomes.

What is lifestyle? In this context, a summation of habits, AKA consistent behavioral patterns, which very importantly are deeply intertwined with their identity. My definition, STUDENTS CAN ADD.

Whether CV, non-specific pain, cancers, respiratory system disorders, in many cases a sizable chunk of etiology directly attributable to *modifiable* lifestyle factors, things that we can do something about.

**Key words: consistent behavioral patterns, identity**. Identity - (interests, opinions, beliefs, sense of self, their values, the needs they fill in this world). These two concepts are *fundamental* to answering the question of how we best can help people change their lifestyle.

So when we say lifestyle change, what we're really referring to is behavior change + identity change. You cannot have one without the other, it will fall to pieces.

Today we're going start with behavior, and we'll bring identity into the picture as we advance.

So, behavior. There's a word that encapsulates everything that drives a person's behavior, the reasons why people do what they do in any given moment, is...?

**MOTIVATION**

The theme of today's lecture. To understand behavior, identity, and lifestyle, and how to change it, we need to understand motivation. And once we understand it, we will be equipped to "motivate our patients to change their lifestyle.""

How many times have you heard that phrase? As if motivation is some property that we impart onto others.

Or how about, "she's highly motivated" or, "I could use some of his motivation." As if it's a linear quantity, like you have it or you don't, and if you want to be more successful in changing a person's behavior, you just need to motivate them more.

How does this typically play out? Let's use a clinical example.

"Dave, with your smoking habits, you're on course to develop COPD"

"...okay, what does that mean?" (thinks: I enjoy smoking, I don't want to stop)

"You're going to live with breathing difficulties, if you don't quit smoking soon"

"that sucks, but I don't..."

"You could end up in the hospital on life support" (thoughts: How long will this go on for??? This is stressing me out so much, I could really use a cigarette... I hope my boss )

"You'll die and leave your family without financial support" (thinks: I hope my boss doesn't fire me next week, I know my performance at work hasn't been good and he's been grumpy lately)

"Okay okay, I'll stop it now."

"Good, come back in six months and we'll see how you're doing"

Thoughts: Thank god this prick shut up... I'm relieved I don't have to listen to him any more. Damn it, I'm running late to pick up my kids from school.


You just up the ante, up the threat, or perhaps up the reward, but it doesn't work.






If motivation were as simple as telling people escalating the consequences or rewards




Before we take the plunge into the psychological theory of motivation and how to apply it, I briefly want to return to a word I mentioned just before - *"modifiable."*

There's always *something* the patient can change, even if they aren't able to see it as clearly as we can. 

MINDSET:
We see from a perspective, like giving advice to friends. We can become stuck. So if we want to help people change their behavior, we have to understand what makes people change their behavior. How to be good coaches. This is the mindset we need to have, the approach we must take if we want to have the highest chance of success - we *cannot* change a person's behaviors for them, and we *cannot* motivate them to change.
Lifestyle coaches



So much of long-term success hinges on lifestyle change. This falls in the realm of behavioral psychology, and today, I want to explore a key element at the very core of behavior. What might that be?

**Motivation!**

I'm going to present some modern psychological theory on motivation, and we're going to find out how we can apply this in the clinic to get .

We'll spend the first half of class learning about a theory of motivation known as self-determination theory, and we'll spend the second half of class learning about a counselling technique called motivational interviewing, which adheres to the principles of SDT and can be used to help coach people to change their behavior.

The trick is to find out how to help people motivate themselves... we can't motivate them! Very poor. *present idea before*
