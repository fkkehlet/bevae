When you decide to seek professional help for a pain problem, finding a highly competent clinician is no straightforward task. Aside from the fact that many clinicians remain blissfully unaware of modern developments in the research on pain, what constitutes "optimal" care depends entirely on who you are. After all, your biology, psychology, and sociocultural context are unique to you.

While there are countless treatment modalities and strategies, there exist a few fundamental principles that every good clinician should follow (or at least try). No matter which sort of pain problem you have, these "ground rules" serve as a litmus test for telling the best apart from the rest.

Socioeconomic status and luck play an important role in determining the quality of care that is available to you. Despite any obstacles you may be facing, having access to accurate information and asking the right questions will get you on the path to success in the pursuit of total physical, mental, and social health.

This article isn't perfect. It doesn't cover everything there is to talk about, nor could it ever hope to! People aren't perfect either, and as with most things in life there are exceptions to the rules. Still, it's my hope that you will find these questions useful to reflect on your own situation. Take everything here with a pinch of salt, exercise critical thinking, and don't forget to approach this topic from a place of positivity and kindness!

## Are they perpetuating or breaking the cycle of dependence?

Persistent pain has a way of creeping into all corners of life, eventually affecting everything from your mood to your relationships and identity. What you decide to do about it has the potential to lead you to the light at the end of the tunnel, but have you considered that it could just as well be keeping you stumbling around in the dark?

It usually starts innocently enough. A new pain appears in your back, knee, wherever. You go see your doctor. After screening for serious diseases, they prescribe a mild painkiller and tell you to put some heat on it and rest. But then it gets worse. Before you know it, it's time again for your weekly massage, manipulation, infrared, ultrasound, acupuncture, or whatever other therapy you signed up for.

The pain diminishes for a short while, but it always comes back again (and this time, it's back with a vengeance). You may be stressing about an upcoming appointment with a surgeon, all while your ability to do the things that bring you happiness slowly withers away over the months and years.

This is an example of the cycle of dependence. If you recognize yourself in this cycle, your number one priority is to get out. Even if your pain has a good prognosis (i.e., prediction about how it will evolve) this cycle is something you will want to avoid at all costs.

To break the cycle, your clinician should facilitate your autonomy and self-management. You might only be in the clinic one hour per week, what you do outside is where the real work lies. Your clinician should explain your condition in a way that makes sense to you, present different options for management going forward, and equip you with the tools and confidence you need to be more independent.

To put it bluntly, your clinician's foremost goal should be to never see you again. Is there a financial incentive to bring you back recurrently? Is there any reason why they might not be actively encouraging your autonomy? The time it takes to gain control, confidence, and independence looks different for everyone, but it is the core of what your clinician should be helping you achieve.

## Do they place a strong emphasis on active therapies?

Active therapies are those where you play an active part. This includes anything from graded activity programs (e.g., weightlifting) to cognitive-focused therapies such as CBT and ACT. It should come as no surprise that passive therapies, predicated on the idea of *receiving treatment* as opposed to you *putting treatment in action,* are not something you should spend too much time on if your goal is to escape or avoid the cycle of dependence.

The relief offered by passive therapies such as massage, acupuncture, or ultrasound is short lived. They simply cannot offer the stimulation needed to build physical and mental resilience, overcome fears, learn healthy coping strategies, regain control, and reduce pain sensitivity in the same way that active approaches to therapy do.

Some pains improve with the passage of time no matter what, but if you want to have the highest chance of succeeding at your long-term health goals, you must recognize that quick fixes do not exist. There is no pill, needle, scalpel, or laser beam which will "cure" you of pain and disability. Recovering health and function requires a combination of intelligent decision making, patience, and persistence.

Passive therapies, invasive procedures, and continual medical management may form part of a holistic pain treatment strategy that's right for you, but they can never replace the vital role that active therapies fulfill. The key is to not give them more attention than they deserve. As soon as they take priority over therapies where you are an active participant, you've "lost the game," so to speak.

Your clinician should work with you to implement sustainable lifestyle changes, taking into account your physical, mental, and social needs. For example, if you're finding it difficult to integrate more physical activity into your life (or struggling to dial it back), your clinician should be by your side coaching you through this process.

Does your clinician offer a pick-and-choose passive therapy buffet with discounts if you come back for more? Is their only activity-related recommendation "staying active?" Red flag! Not everyone needs intensive therapy to recover, and some kinds of pain are actually well managed with a hands off "wait and watch" approach. But if you feel like you're struggling to cope with your pain, disability, and suffering, the bottom line is this:

Your clinician must help you make sense of your pain, navigate barriers to recovery such as unhelpful beliefs and expectations, and modify behaviors and activities to the extent necessary to reduce your sensitivity to pain and promote your long-term health and independence. None of this is going to happen with a passive approach. If they can not or will not shift to an active-first mentality, it might be time to ask for a referral.

## Do they inspire trust, confidence, and safety?

Pain is a protective response designed to keep your body safe from danger. This means that threats in the environment, whether *actually* dangerous or simply perceived as such (both are equally "real," the brain does not discriminate), profoundly affect your experience of pain both in the moment and its development over time as your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors change in response. The greater the perceived threat, the greater the effect it will likely have.

Health-related decisions are some of the most important and personally relevant decisions you will ever make. Add to this the fact that your clinician is intimately involved in helping you get through some of the most vulnerable periods of your life, and it's easy to see why the last thing you would ever want is for your clinician to be perceived as a threat! Your clinician, more than anything, should be a reliable source of safety.

To ensure a sense of safety, it is essential to form a relationship with your clinician based on mutual trust. Trust can take time to develop, but don't disregard first impressions. Pay close attention to the feeling you walk away with after an initial consultation with a new clinician. Do they leave you feeling empowered and inspired? Or depressed and anxious?

Your clinician should inspire boundless confidence. It is well known that self-efficacy (i.e., self-belief) is one of the most important determinants of long-term health outcomes. Finding confidence in your own body when it feels like it's failing you is exceedingly difficult. But while you might not always believe in your ability to climb that mountain, your clinician sure as hell should.

Does your clinician add to your anxiety? Does it seem like they aren't really interested in listening to you? It goes without saying that a clinical environment characterized by disinterest, fearmongering, and pessimism poses a great hurdle to you evolving in a positive direction.

## Do they set goals and monitor progression?

The unfortunate reality is that many clinicians do not practice intelligent goal setting. Goals give direction to pain management and rehabilitation. You and your clinician should collaborate to set realistic goals, taking into account your preferences, values, and other constraints.

Once you and your clinician have worked together to identify overarching long-term goals, you must break them into *staged goals*. Staged goals are achievable in smaller timeframes and form the basis for planned progression, another crucial aspect of best-practice therapy which is often forgotten by clinicians outside of professional sports contexts.

Planned progression means that when you reach a predetermined goal, you are going to progress in some way in order to work toward the next stage. Feeling safe and confident is paramount, but challenging yourself is equally as important! Gradually improving mental and physical resilience is one of the key ways the pain system desensitizes, but no meaningful progress will be made in this regard if the stimulus is not sufficient.

Pain management without goals and planned progression is like trying to hit a bullseye in darkness. Setting attainable goals and monitoring progress is like turning on the light, it's much easier to aim accurately when you know what you're aiming at and how close you are to the target!

Goal setting and planning is vital, but you can't control the result of your actions. You and your clinician should therefore work on a *process oriented* mindset. Instead of stressing about achieving a specific goal at a specific time (the result), focus on what you can control (the process). What can you do in the here and now to raise your chances of succeeding in the future?

And the future is incredibly unpredictable, especially when it comes to something as complex as pain. Be it stalled progress or a stressful setback, all plans must change. Your clinician should know how to react to whatever comes up during the process and help you work through or around it.

## Are they afraid of saying "I don't know?"

Humility is a virtue, nowhere more so than in medicine. Humanity collectively understands a lot about pain and painful conditions, but there is still a lot we don't know. There are also many things that your clinician does not know, whether they admit it or not.

Some clinicians give false impressions of their knowledge and abilities. One archetype to watch out for is the "certificate collector." You know, the person who has a dozen diplomas hanging on their wall from all the weekend courses they've attended. This says more about their desire to be *perceived* as wise than their actual discernment.

The best clinicians set their ego aside in the clinic and put YOU at the center of care. They should not be trying to show off how great they are. A great way to assess this is simply by asking questions. If you ask questions, eventually you should get the response, "I don't know." If your clinician never says "I don't know," it might be that their pride and arrogance prevents them from admitting that they do not, in fact, know everything.

Your clinician should then offer to research the topic for you and get back to you with an answer, or direct you to someone who does know. They should also be able to recognize if you would benefit from no treatment, or from beginning a clinical relationship with someone else.
