When you decide to seek professional help for a pain problem, finding a highly competent clinician is no straightforward task. Aside from the fact that many clinicians are unaware of modern pain science, what constitutes "optimal" care depends entirely on who you are. After all, your biology, psychology, and sociocultural context are unique to you.

While there are countless treatment modalities, there exist a few fundamental principles that every good clinician follows (or at least tries to). No matter which sort of pain problem you have, these "ground rules" serve as a litmus test for telling the best apart from the rest.

Socioeconomic status and luck play an important role in determining the quality of care that is available to you. Despite any obstacles you may be facing, having access to accurate information and asking the right questions will get you on the path to long-term success in the pursuit of total physical, mental, and social health.

It's my hope that you will find these questions useful to reflect on your own situation. This article isn't perfect - it doesn't cover everything there is to talk about, nor could it ever hope to! People aren't perfect either, and as with most things in life there are exceptions to the rules. Take everything here with a pinch of salt, exercise critical thinking, and don't forget to approach this topic from a place of positivity and kindness!

## Are they perpetuating or breaking the cycle of dependence?

Persistent pain has a way of creeping into all corners of life, eventually affecting everything from your mood to your relationships and identity. What you decide to do about it has the potential to lead you to the light at the end of the tunnel, but have you considered that it could just as well be keeping you stumbling around in the dark?

It usually starts innocently enough. A new pain appears in your back, knee, wherever. You go see your doctor. After screening for serious diseases, they prescribe a mild painkiller and tell you to put some heat on it and rest.

But then it gets worse. Before you know it, it's time again for your weekly massage, manipulation, infrared, ultrasound, acupuncture, or whatever other therapy you signed up for. The pain diminishes for a short while, but it always comes back again (and this time, it's back with a vengeance). You may be stressing about an upcoming appointment with a surgeon, all while your ability to do the things that bring you happiness slowly withers away over the months and years.

This is an example of the cycle of dependence. If you recognize yourself in this cycle, your number one priority should be to get out. Even if your pain has a good prognosis (i.e., prediction about how it will evolve) it's something you want to avoid at all costs.

Your clinician must facilitate your autonomy. This usually starts with identifying any contributing factors to your pain. Your clinician should be able to explain your pain and/or medical condition in a way that makes sense to you and then equip you with the tools and confidence you need to self-manage. After all, you might only be in the clinic one hour per week... what about the other 167?

To put it bluntly, your clinician's foremost goal should be to never see you again. Is there a financial incentive to bring you back recurrently? Is there any reason why they may be might not be actively encouraging your autonomy? The time it takes to gain independence looks different for everyone, but it is the core of all best-practice pain management programs.

I want to make it very clear that for certain kinds of pain, surgery and/or continual medical management are indispensible. That's why it is so important that you do not interpret this article as personalized medical advice. Ask a trusted health professional about your condition and don't be afraid to seek out second opinions.

## Do they place a strong emphasis on active therapies?

Simply put, active therapies are those where you play an active part. This includes anything from weightlifting to cognitive behavioral therapy. It should come as no surprise that passive therapies, predicated on the idea of *receiving treatment* as opposed to you *putting treatment in action,* are not something you should spend too much time on if your goal is to escape the cycle of dependence.


The relief offered by passive therapies is short-lived. They just cannot offer the stimulation you need to build physical and mental resilience, overcome fears, learn healthy coping strategies, regain control, and reduce pain sensitivity in the same way that active approaches to therapy do.

Some pains improve on their own with the passage of time no matter what you do, but if you want to have the highest chance of succeeding at your long-term health goals, you first have to recognize that there is no pill, needle, scalpel, or laser beam which will "cure" you of your pain.

Quick fixes do not exist. Physical, mental, and social health is not something that *just happens*, it takes hard work applied consistently over time. Passive therapies and invasive procedures may form part of a holistic pain management strategy that's right for you, but they can never replace the vital role that active therapies fulfill.

That isn't to say manual therapy and high-tech treatments don't have their place. In some cases they can provide the springboard you need to take a leap forward. Passive therapies are useful to the extent that they help you get more out of active therapies - the key is to not give them more attention than they deserve. As soon as they take priority over therapies where you are an active participant, you've lost the game.

Does your clinician offer a pick-and-choose passive therapy buffet with discounts if you come back for more? Red flag! If all they do after the umpteenth ultrasound session is give some vague recommendation about "staying active" at home... there is a *lot* of room for improvement, to say the least.

Your clinician should work with you to implement sustainable lifestyle changes, taking into account your physical, mental, and social needs. For example, if you're finding it difficult to integrate more physical activity into your life (or perhaps you're struggling to dial it back) they should be coaching you through this process.

Not everyone needs intensive therapy to recover well, and some kinds of pain are actually best managed with a hands-off, "let's wait and keep an eye on it" approach. But if you're reading this and feel like you're struggling to cope with your pain, disability, and suffering, the bottom line is this:

Your clinician must help you make sense of your pain, navigate barriers to recovery such as unhelpful beliefs and expectations, and modify behaviors and activities to the extent necessary to reduce your sensitivity to pain and facilitate your long-term health and independence. None of this is going to happen with a passive approach. If they can not or will not shift to an active-first mentality, it might be time to ask for a referral.

## Do they inspire trust, confidence, and safety?

When it comes to pain, safety is the name of the game. Pain is a protective response designed to keep us safe. This means that perceived threats in the environment affect your pain experience, your responses and behaviors, and ultimately the pain's evolution. The greater the perceived threat, the greater an effect it will likely have.

Health-related decisions are some of the most important and personally relevant decisions you will ever make. Add to this the fact that your clinician is intimately involved in helping you get through the most vulnerable periods of your life, and it's easy to see why the last thing you would ever want is for them to be perceived as a threat. Your clinician needs to be a reliable source of safety!

Because of this, building a clinical relationship based on mutual trust is absolutely essential. Trust can take time to develop, but first impressions should not be underestimated. The feeling you walk away with after an initial consultation with a new clinician is invaluable information that you should take into account when deciding whether or not to continue the relationship.

Your clinician should also inspire boundless confidence. It is well known that self-efficacy (i.e., self-belief) is one of the most important determinants of long term health outcomes. Finding confidence in your own body when it feels like it's failing you is exceedingly difficult. But while you might not always believe in your ability to overcome mountainous obstacles, your clinician should.

Does your clinician add to your anxiety? Do it seem like they aren't really interested in listening to you? These are things you should be paying close attention to. It goes without saying that a clinical environment characterized by disinterest, fearmongering, and pessimism poses a great hurdle to you gaining the strength necessary to move in a positive direction.

## Do they set goals and monitor progression?

The unfortunate reality is that many clinicians do not practice intelligent goal setting. Goals give direction to pain rehabilitation programs. You and your clinician should collaborate to set realistic goals, taking into account your valued activities, preferences, and other constraints.

Once you and your clinician have worked together to identify overarching long term goals, you must break them into staged goals achievable in smaller timeframes. Staged goals allow for planned progression, another crucial aspect of active therapy which is often ignored by clinicians outside of professional sports contexts.

Planned progression means that when you reach a predetermined goal, you are going to progress in some way in order to work toward the next stage. Feeling safe and confident is paramount, but challenging yourself is equally as important! Gradually improving mental and physical resilience is one of the key ways the pain system desensitizes, but no meaningful progress will be made in this regard if the stimulus is not sufficient.

Pain management without goals and planned progression is like trying to hit a bullseye in darkness. Monitoring function and symptoms over time is like turning on the light, it's much easier to aim accurately when you can see what you're doing!

## Are they afraid of saying "I don't know?"

Some people are really good at giving false impressions of authority and intelligence. One such archetype to watch out for is the "certificate collector." You know, the clinician who has a dozen diplomas hanging on their wall. This often says more about their desire to be *perceived* as knowledgeable than their actual abilities and wisdom.

Inflated egos are common in all areas of life, and this is no less true in the medical field. The best clinicians will put YOU at the center. What does this mean in practice? If you ask questions, eventually you should get the response, "I don't know."

When they don't know something, they should be able to direct you to someone who does.

Informing you about the potential risks and benefits of each treatment...

Do reseach on it, come back to you with the answer.

Recognize, "I'm not the best to treat you"

- Education
- "Are they explaining the problem to me/ what is going on in my body?"
- Do they help you identify contributing factors, and show you what you can do with this information
- In a way that YOU can understand
- Give you external sources of information
