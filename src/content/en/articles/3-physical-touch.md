Touch is a sense, and it's a really important one. It is deeply intertwined with our evolutionary history as social primates. As such, the use of hands-on approaches to diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and ailments stretches very far back in time, likely long before recorded history began. But with the advent of modern medicine and its strong emphasis on scientific inquiry, the use of touch (more specifically, manual therapy) in the clinic has come under fire.

Doctors are licensed to physically touch their patients but typically don't perform hands-on treatments, and to find a psychologist or psychotherapist that physically touches their patients is very difficult. However, a number of professions - including but not limited to osteopathy, chiropractic, and phyiotherapy (setting aside differences in scope of practice and regulation) - have historically been based almost entirely on manual therapy, with associated clinical reasoning frameworks and narratives justifying their existence.

These are professions which are now faced with the tough challenge of staying relevant in today's healthcare climate. Buy nowadays, the question, "does manual therapy have a place in modern practice?" can be heard everywhere.

Some of these professions' identities are inseparable from manual therapy. In this article I will argue that we should *not* eschew hands-on approaches. We need to take full advantage of physical contact - but we must reconceptualize its role not in the way that most people still think we should (and with a number of caveats).

and serves various functions related to signaling reward, reciprocity, and safety. Nonhuman primates may spend hours every day grooming each other, and people in various cultures around the world spend plenty of time in physical contact with one another, but in the western world, many people live touch-deprived lives. We know that this can cause a lot of stress and have far-reaching negative effects, inhibiting the immune system, amplifying depression, and more.

## Why is touch useful?

Tommaso Geri and colleagues published a nice paper in 2019 (linked below in the further reading section) which gives us a high-level overview of the different ways touch can affect us. Most of these points might be obvious, but it's always good to approach these topics through a scientific lens, which provides us with a scaffolding to categorize and think about concepts.

### Analgesic touch

First of all, touch can be analgesic. It modulates pain around the painful location, lowering the intensity and detail of painful sensations. When a body part hurts, it's instinctive to want to press or rub it in order to diminish the pain, check for bodily integrity, or self-soothe.

In therapeutic contexts, the person receiving care may be positively primed to be touched through expectations of receiving touch. Though this certainly doesn't hold true for every person, nor for every context, it should be kept in mind when deciding how you balance a hands-on vs. hands-off approach with the person in front of you. Being caressed (i.e., firm but gentle touch) may represent a rewarding and pleasant experience that can facilitate pain reduction.

> Indeed, it has been suggested that the degree of empathy demonstrated during touch correlates with the level of analgesia experienced by the partner through the toucher’s tactile stimulus (Goldstein et al., 2016; Korisky et al., 2020). All reaffirm the integral role that empathy plays in the TA and the patient management in MSK care.

### Affective touch

primary function of the nervous system is to manage allostasis, i.e., predicting the physiological needs for survival

Touch also has a powerful affective component. We know that it's an important vector for conveying emotion and context. Touching the patient can encourage feelings of safety and relaxation and reduce stress, anxiety, and avoidance (once again, we see how it all comes back to threat vs. safety). The key here is the intention behind the touch, which must be non-threatening. Your intention plays a large part in determining whether or not this nonverbal information is communicated effectively.

In addition to your basic intention behind touching your patients being non-threatening in nature, your own emotions during physical contact should be in sync with what the patient is feeling in that moment. If you don't have a high level of emotional intelligence, all I can say is: practice, practice, practice!

We could all do with more practice. It's just hard to overstate how important this synchrony is in order to break down psychological and social barriers between you and your patient. It can help both parties to open up emotionally and builds trust and empathy within the therapeutic relationship (see: caveats).

We are able to identify emotions someone is feeling just through touch!

> Holding hands, hugging, cuddling, they’re all pretty good. What we find is that when you apply more pressure, moderate pressure, as in a hug or giving a person a back rub, the effects are more positive than providing less pressure. Light stroking is a bit aversive to most people because they feel like they’re being tickled. … Heart rate decreases when you’re getting moderate pressure. Heart rate increases when you’re getting light pressure. Same with blood pressure. When we looked at brain waves, we get an increase in theta waves, which is what typically accompanies relaxation when we do moderate pressure. When we do light pressure, we get an increase in beta waves, which is what we usually see when someone is aroused.

### Somatoperceptual touch (rephrase!)

Cortical reorganization is a well-studied phenomenon that is associated with a wide variety of persistent pain conditions. A hands-on approach to therapy may improve the patient's body perception through reorganizing the  mental representations of our bodies.

Certain body regions are hidden from sight, such as the back. Touch may be able to guide the patient to better localize their pain and tactile stimuli on their body surface. Exteroceptive stimuli (i.e., coming from outside) such as a clinician's touch may promote a more integrated body perception, offering the patient a chance to discriminate between safe and threatening stimuli, promoting the conscious perception of an intact body.

Visual feedback has a positive influence on pain perception, and in a way, the clinician's hands may act similarly to the patient's eyes, enhancing their sense of body ownership and improving their perceived sense of agency.

It can be a great tool for selective attention.

## Implications

Several key implications emerge from the paper by Geri and colleagues, some of which I've already briefly touched on, but it will help to define them explicitly.

The exploitation of hands-on techniques as a specific I form of touch offers four main important consequences to the physiotherapy profession:

Two broad categories: discriminative (Abeta fibers) and affective touch (c-tactile afferents, slow touch system... "affective touch is associated with tactile stimuli with a hedonic and often emotional component, encompassing aspects of reward and significance in social communications" )

#### "It is not therapeutic if it is not sympathetic."

> Touch can often provide the sensory evidence to help conclude that “you are like me” through stimulating biobehavioural synchrony
"Just like me" - reinforced by non-nocebic communication, reassurance, deepening personal connection through personal disclosure of past

We need to keep in mind

Clinicians should remember that manual techniques are not tools to fix the patient’s body, rather they provide the opportunity to communicate with the patient’s brain similar to words. For instance, during the interaction with a person, we can talk using a high or light tone of voice, speaking slowly or speedily, with emphasis or dosing the brakes (what is called “dynamics” in a music performance) with different relapses on our communication.

Communication mediated by the touch occurs in the same way. Consequently, clinicians should select the Tappropriate “dynamics” when administering hands-on techniques, characterized through the properties of the physical (e.g., location, dimension of contact area, intensity, velocity of execution, contact frequency and timing) and emotional (e.g., kindness, reception, affectivity, firmness) stimulus.

Therefore, it would be appropriate to focus future research efforts on the physical properties, location and administration methods of the stimulus conveyed to the patients, independently of the kind of manual technique applied (e.g., joint mobilisation, soft tissues intervention, neural sliding). This perspective may help the comparison of manual techniques beyond the supposed biomechanical or neurophysiological rationale.

#### Educators should be aware of the overall therapeutic possibilities of touch that span from the correct execution of manual techniques to the wider consideration of the connection to the patient’s body perception and emotions.

This paradigm shift requires a continuous development of relation skills to establish an emotional communication with the patients. Teachers Pshould develop a formalization and a more comprehensive I science of the “affective touch”. To do this, students should be trained in manual techniques as well as in communication skills with a paradigm shift from the Suse of biomechanical and neurophysiological constructs alone, to the wider consideration of the patient pain experience and emotional communication N as informative for technique design.

These two aspects need special Aattention to establish an empathetic contact with the patients that would ease the emergence of the affective touch. Knowledge of biomechanical and anatomical features maintains nevertheless its importance to support the correct execution of hands-on techniques to achieve the intended physical stimulus.

#### Researchers should orient their investigations on two emerging areas: the “affective touch” and the reorganization of mental representation.

Affective touch and somatoperceptual touch, blurring the lines between physical and emotional phenomena, is an exciting field of ongoing research which we should pay close attention to.

We must reconceptualize touch from being something that "fixes" a person's body, to viewing it through an analgesic, emotional, and somatoperceptual lens - in other words, a perspective


Through the latter, we may refine the modalities in which we already use hand-on techniques, in order to promote body map reorganization (e.g., through interactive patient involvement in drive selective attention on body sites where tactile stimuli were applied). This perspective reinforces the need for an enlarged multidisciplinary research approach to musculoskeletal pain involving, for example, specialists from fields apparently distant from the clinic e.g. semantics, psychology, ethnology

#### Physiotherapy associations should promote the therapeutic role of hands-on techniques and claim their specificity, even though not exclusive, for the Physiotherapy profession.

There is the need to state firmly that touching a person is a therapeutic act per se, delivered according to precise theoretical constructs (e.g., neurophysiological, biomechanical, psychological) to insure its results. The relationship between the patient and the physiotherapist, unlike any other ones, represent a particular context in which the physiotherapist has the legitimate permission to have a close contact with the patient’s body. Considering also the emotional component carried with the touch, only trained and registered healthcare providers should use this approach in clinical setting.

## Ways of using touch in the clinic

> Touch in the clinical context forms part of a range of examination and therapeutic interventions such as manual therapy (Rondoni et al., 2017). It is also central to enhancing communication, patient compliance, cueing and assisting patients to reduce pain, and improving clinical outcomes. manual therapy techniques should be viewed as a vehicle to deliver touch effects, which can have a positive influence on the sense of “self,” wellbeing, and body image, as well as a profound calming and soothing influence on the individual.

### "Comfort contact" and building the therapeutic alliance

> "Comfort contact", as it can contribute to patients feeling more comfortable with their HCP, .... decrease stress through reassurance and achieving a secure attachment, a more vital relationship and a sense of safety that helps to regulate and accurately predict the physiological effects of stress and general health

Effective reassurance includes affectionate interactions such as therapeutic relationship building and interpersonal skills, an individualized patient-centered approach, education and the provision of self-management strategies. It should be noted that some interactions that use pathoanatomic models led patients to misinterpret the information provided, this created feelings of fear.

> A predictable and positive relationship between the HCP and a positive TA is considered more influential than individual attachment preferences, including any pre-existing anxieties when developing a new relationship with another individual (Taylor et al., 2015). In clinical practice, collaborative interpersonal relationships also contribute to patient control and self-efficacy by encouraging active participation and adherence to exercises (Babatunde et al., 2017; Kinney et al., 2018). Therefore, touch could help develop a successful collaborative and therapeutic relationship contributing to the good clinical benefits of a positive TA (Miciak et al., 2019)

> The TA is centred around the tripartite elements of a working alliance described by Bordin (1979), including the agreement on goals, agreement on a task, and the development of attachment bonds, which are the foundation for a successful TA.

### As a part of the diagnostic reasoning process

> Health Care providers are in a unique position: it is often considered central and expected to clinically examine and therefore touch a wide area of the body, including the head and neck, generally reserved for more intimate or significant relationships (Geri et al., 2019). Additionally, it helps in the accuracy of HCP to infer the other individual’s emotions, detected through touch (Hertenstein et al., 2009; Geri et al., 2019).

> Therefore, instead of considering manual examination findings only in terms of how they should “guide” manual therapy interventions (i.e. this motion segment is perceived as hypomobile by the clinician and/or painful by the patient, so mobilisation is indicated), we propose that interpretation of manual examination findings should be based upon a contemporary, multidimensional understanding of pain disorders , and viewed as just one, albeit important, part of the information gathered during an examination that considers N relative contributions from multiple dimensions to formulate an individualised treatment Aapproach. Indeed, rather than judging the merit of clinical tests solely on their reliability, consideration of the findings from clinical tests in an integrated manner within clinical reasoning processes has been previously D advocated, particularly in complex, changeable pain states.

"Manual examination reveals localised, heightened pressure sensitivity over the L1 spinous process"

> To eliminate manual examination from the clinical evaluation would mean the loss of important data that can be usefully interpreted in terms of modern pain science -- muscle guarding!

> Empirical evidence has demonstrated that people want a physical examination, highlighted by a person with LBP in a study exploring the meaning of diagnostic tests: “And he still won’t examine me ...you’ve got to put your hands on somebody...you I can’t fix a car just by looking at it”

> In addition to the aforementioned benefits of manual examination, conducting a physical examination may in part contribute to the perceived credibility of the clinician and help establish trust and a positive therapeutic alliance. Ignoring patient preferences negatively impacts on the therapeutic relationship. Thus we argue that in most clinical cases a physical examination incorporating manual examination is appropriate. The use of manual therapy as a treatment technique will be influenced by the specific presentation as demonstrated in the vignettes. However, consideration of patient preferences could also be taken into account as matching expectations is associated with good functional outcomes. We suggest that where manual therapy is used it should be applied alongside an honest explanation of its short-term hypoalgesic effects whilst challenging any associated biomedical beliefs. Matched home exercises should be employed to consciously move the locus of control to the person experiencing pain.

As always, talking about manual therapy specifically, it should be an adjunct treatment. Something that isn't performed with every patient. I don't think that touch generally *necessarily* needs to be, but it should be way more integrated into the underlying treatment philosophy, if it's a tool you have at your disposal.

It takes practice to be confident. Insecurity you feel will be transmitted through to the patient, and in this case where contextual effects are literally the entire game, it. This might be a great time to apply "fake it until you make it".

Manual therapy can be useful as an explanatory tool. It allows clinicians show patients how their pain is malleable when they otherwise might think it isn't, and provides a perfect opportunity to explain how this works, namely by changing sensitivity, which may be used as a launching off point to discuss how other activities and therapies modulate pain through changing sensitivity.

> manual therapy techniques are based on the physical properties of the delivered stimulus (requiring knowledge of anatomy, biomechanics and neurophysiology) as well as on the emotional properties that emerge from the sympathetic contact established with the patient. Manual therapists should develop relationship and communicative skills allowing this kind of touch to emerge. Recognition of the therapeutic value of C touch as one of the most qualifying professional acts of physiotherapists is needed and guarantees patients of its best evidence-based delivering.

### Manual therapy

Touch extends far beyond just providing a mobilization on a treatment table. But this wouldn't be a complete article without addressing the elephant in the room: manual therapy.

> As an opportunity, it has increased the awareness of the value of this treatment solution as effective to improve pain, function and to facilitate pain-free movement without ‘fixing’ or ‘cure’ any structural deficits. As a pitfall, it has left a sense of loss among clinicians and teachers involved in orthopaedic manual therapy, thus considering the possibility to Pdecrease the effort of teaching them or to abandon the techniques from their therapeutic toolbox in favour of active and psychological strategies

> Even though we are mature enough to accept a transformation of our heritage as a sign of professional development, we have to recognize that hands-on techniques are a core element of physiotherapy identity (Nicholls and AHolmes, 2012) appreciated and expected by patients in the context of a therapeutic ritual historically founded on the use of touch. During the clinical encounter, physiotherapists use their hands to: offer care, obtain information E about the patient’s complaints during the physical examination, prepare the patient for treatment, and deliver a therapeutic intervention (Roger E et al., 2002). In clinical practice the ‘hands-on’ ritual highlights the technical competence of the professional (e.g., skills for soft tissues C palpation or joint mobilization); express humanization of the healthcare experience (e.g., communicate compassion and support beyond spoken words); and define physical, personal and professional boundaries (e.g., create a safe space where the therapy can be delivered) (Kelly et al., 2018).

> I use manual therapy to prove to patients that their pain is about sensitivity. Manual therapy isn’t about correcting anything, although it may help in the short run. It’s about changing what they feel and helping to believe in their adaptive potential. I often fake manual therapy. For example, I might “correct” the scapula with a scapular assistance test and then have the patient lift their arm – and it hurts less. After 1-2 repetitions, instead of pushing the scapula, I just twist the skin – still less pain. Then, I twist the skin in another direction - still less pain. Then, as they keep lifting, I stop “correcting” completely – still less pain! I explain that there is no way I’ve corrected their scapular motion. Rather, I’ve changed how they feel - their sensitivity. Perhaps they became more confident, less fearful. Perhaps something happened in the brain (likely, but I don’t always get into it). I use that change as a learning tool and then use exercises to reinforce the new perception (a nice discussion can be found

## Caveats

There are several important caveats that must be pointed out. The first is that everyone has different personal limits of what they are comfortable with.

Doctors, for example, may opt to forego components of a physical exam that includes private areas. Some people might be dissatisfied and worry something important could have been missed, while others may feel relief.

It's always helpful to explain all of the steps involved in the physical examination beforehand, so the patient doesn't encounter any unpleasant surprises. If you can, get to know your patient's preference about physical touch upfront, so you can better understand their needs and help them to feel safe.

It is also crucial to remember the fact that some people may experience posttraumatic stress as a result of having been physically or sexually abused. Here more than anywhere else it's important to respect personal space boundaries and to not be careless about physical contact, lest you unnecessarily retrigger latent traumatic memories.

Generally, it's important to maintain open communication with your patients. Whether you're performing a physical examination, giving a massage, or gently holding hands with someone being vulnurable about a difficult moment in their life, ask for permission (especially if you aren't great at identifying their emotional state through nonverbal cues). Always lean on the side of caution, to make sure the patient feels safe and in charge. "Is it okay if I move a little closer?", or "would you like to take my hand?" are typical questions you might ask.

Properly used, touch has the potential to transform the practice of medicine. Touch deprivation increases depression and aggression. Touching patients with Alzheimer’s disease can have huge effects on getting them to relax, make emotional connections with others, and reduce their symptoms of depression.

## Beyond touch

I'd like to conclude this article with an invitation to think about how we use all of our senses.

Eye gaze is important as well! Think about how you're using your senses

I think we need to have more touch in the school system. I know private schools, they’re allowed to touch kids, but in a lot of public schools there’s a mandate against touching, and I think that has to change. And it’s only going to change if parent-teacher associations are encouraging teachers to touch the kids. I would say we can have kids giving each other back rubs. That’s happening in Europe in preschools, for example, kids are taught that.
