The use of manual therapy stretches far back in time.

Since the profession's inception, manual therapy

Nowadays, physiotherapists are among the few. Chiropractors and osteopaths, though it bears mentioning that for all of these professions, regulation varies a great deal internationally. Doctors, licensed to touch their patients, very rarely if ever take advantage of the power of touch as will be explored in this article. Psychologists, unfortunately, non-starter.

For many years, manual therapy has been biomechanical in nature.

With the rise and adoption of the biopsychosocial model, the allied medical professions


New models of manual therapy cognitive science are uncovering


> As an opportunity, it has increased the awareness of the value of this treatment solution as effective to improve pain, function and to facilitate pain-free movement without ‘fixing’ or ‘cure’ any structural deficits (Lewis and O’Sullivan, 2018). As a pitfall, it has left a sense of loss among clinicians and teachers involved in orthopaedic manual therapy, thus considering the possibility to Pdecrease the effort of teaching them or to abandon the techniques from their therapeutic toolbox in favour of active and psychological strategies

> Even though we are mature enough to accept a transformation of our heritage as a sign of professional development, we have to recognize that hands-on techniques are a core element of physiotherapy identity (Nicholls and AHolmes, 2012) appreciated and M  expected by patients in the context of a therapeutic ritual historically founded on the use of touch. During the clinical encounter, physiotherapists use their hands to: offer care, obtain information E about the patient’s complaints during the physical Texamination, prepare the patient for treatment, and deliver a therapeutic intervention (Roger E et al., 2002). In clinical practice the ‘hands-on’ ritual highlights the technical competence of the professional (e.g., skills for soft tissues C palpation or joint mobilization); express humanization of the healthcare experience (e.g., communicate compassion and support beyond spoken words); and define physical, personal and professional boundaries (e.g., create a safe space where the therapy can be delivered) (Kelly et al., 2018).

### Analgesic touch

> Instinctively, each of us is unwittingly inclined to place a hand on a hurting body part, caressing, pressing, sustaining it, checking for body integrity or simply providing some form of self-support for anxiety reduction. The instinctive body touching to reduce pain is probably ancient like the human history and its origin is lost in the mists of time

> Touch is able A to produce pain modulation in a body area around to the location where painful stimuli are simultaneously administered, biasing signal detection, buffering the rating of pain intensity and quality of sensation

### Affective touch

> **The touched person can recognize emotions conveyed by the toucher, but only if the touch is contextual** (Goldstein 2016)

> The fact of being immersed in a therapeutic context with N expectations of being touched, per se positively prepares the brain to be Atouched (Andersen and Lundqvist, M 2019). On the other hand, caressing, like applying any other kind of manual approach adequate enough to stimulate C- Tactile fibres (the so called 'affective D touch') (Croy et al., 2016), may represent a rewarding and pleasant E therapeutic experience that facilitates affiliative Tbehaviours (Walker et al., 2017) and pain reduction. These effects are mediated P by neuroendocrine E signals, including the activation of endogenous opioids, oxytocin and dopaminergic pathways

>  the sympathetic contact with the patients carries the physiotherapist’s A touch with the meaningful dimension of non-verbal, context- depended communication (Pinto et al., 2012). Touching with this intention promotes positive emotional responses like feelings of safety and relaxation (Walker et al., 2017) and reduces negative affective feelings, avoidance and stress-related biomarkers (e.g. salivary alpha amylase, salivary cortisol, heart rate) through the deactivation of systems related with stressful response to threat (Maratos et al., 2017). When the ‘right’ emotions are delivered according to the patient’s emotional status (a more psycho- than physio-oriented duty), hands-on approaches are capable of producing a dyadic empathetic touch- relationship, helping the removal of psychosocial barriers involved in patient’s T emotional response (Grandi, 2016).

### Somatoperceptual touch

> Beyond the biomechanical constructs, the C hands-on approach may Simprove the patient’s body perception by promoting the reorganization of body U mental representations (Longo, 2015), especially for those body regions hidden N to the vision, as the spine (Nishigami et al., 2015). The physiotherapist’s touch Acan guide the patient to better find M the localisation of pain and tactile stimuli on his body surface (Puentedura and Flynn, 2016). This way, hands-on techniques offer the patient the chance D to discriminate between safe and threatening stimuli, promoting the E conscious perception of an intact body. Realizing that the Tbody is not damaged, nor threatened (Wand et al., 2016) reduces anxiety, P avoidance and E defensive responses (Harvie et al., 2016). Overall, exteroceptive stimuli provided C by physiotherapist may promote a more integrated patient’s body C perception (Serino and Haggard, 2010). Recent findings suggest a positive A influence of visual feedback on pain perception (Heinrich et al., 2019). In this sense physiotherapists' hands may act similarly to patients' eyes, enhancing the sense of body ownership ('this is my body'), and improving the perceived sense of agency ('I'm in control of my body') (Longo et al., 2008).

### Implications

The exploitation of hands-on techniques as a specific I form of touch offers four main important consequences to the physiotherapy profession:

#### It is not therapeutic if it is not sympathetic.

Clinicians C should remember that Smanual techniques are not tools to fix the patient’s body, rather they provide U the opportunity to communicate with the patient’s brain similar to words. For N instance, during the interaction with a person, we can talk using a high or Alight tone of voice, speaking slowly M or speedily, with emphasis or dosing the brakes (what is called “dynamics” in a music performance) with different relapses on our communication. D Communication mediated by the touch occurs in the same E way. Consequently, clinicians should select the Tappropriate “dynamics” when administering hands-on techniques, P characterized E through the properties of the physical (e.g., location, dimension C of contact area, intensity, velocity of execution, contact frequency C and timing) and emotional (e.g., kindness, reception, affectivity, firmness) A stimulus. Therefore, it would be appropriate to focus future research efforts on the physical properties, location and administration methods of the stimulus conveyed to the patients, independently of the kind of manual technique applied (e.g., joint mobilisation, soft tissues intervention, neural sliding). This perspective may help the comparison of manual techniques beyond the supposed biomechanical or neurophysiological rationale.

#### Educators should be aware of the overall therapeutic possibilities of touch that span from the correct execution of manual techniques to the wider consideration of the connection to the patient’s body perception and emotions.

This paradigm shift requires a continuous development of relation T skills to establish an emotional communication with the patients. Teachers Pshould develop a formalization and a more comprehensive I science of the “affective touch”. To do this, students should be R trained in manual techniques as well as in communication skills C with a paradigm shift from the Suse of biomechanical and neurophysiological constructs alone, to the wider U consideration of the patient pain experience and emotional communication N as informative for technique design. These two aspects need special Aattention to establish an empathetic M contact with the patients that would ease the emergence of the affective touch. Knowledge of biomechanical and anatomical features maintains D nevertheless its importance to support the correct execution E of hands-on techniques to achieve the intended physical Tstimulus.

#### Researchers E should orient their investigations on two emerging areas: the “affective C touch” and the reorganization of mental representation.

From the C former research field, we may improve the understanding on how to use A more proficiently the physical properties of touch in a more “emotionally”- oriented perspective. Through the latter, we may refine the modalities in which we already use hand-on techniques, in order to promote body map reorganization (e.g., through interactive patient involvement in drive selective attention on body sites where tactile stimuli were applied). This perspective reinforces the need for an enlarged multidisciplinary research approach to musculoskeletal pain involving, for example, specialists from fields apparently distant from the clinic e.g. semantics, psychology, ethnology

#### Physiotherapy associations should promote the therapeutic role of hands-on techniques and claim their specificity, even though not exclusive, for the Physiotherapy profession.

There is the need to state I firmly that touching a person is a therapeutic act per se, delivered according R to precise theoretical constructs (e.g., neurophysiological, biomechanical, C psychological) to insure Sits results. The relationship between the patient and the physiotherapist, U unlike any other ones, represent a particular context in which the N physiotherapist has the legitimate permission to have a close contact with Athe patient’s body. Considering M also the emotional component carried with the touch, only trained and registered healthcare providers should use this approach in clinical setting. D



But this is a narrative that must be challenged.

Touch extends far beyond just providing a mobilization on a treatment table.

> I use manual therapy to prove to patients that their pain is about sensitivity. Manual therapy isn’t about correcting anything, although it may help in the short run. It’s about changing what they feel and helping to believe in their adaptive potential. I often fake manual therapy. For example, I might “correct” the scapula with a scapular assistance test and then have the patient lift their arm – and it hurts less. After 1-2 repetitions, instead of pushing the scapula, I just twist the skin – still less pain. Then, I twist the skin in another direction - still less pain. Then, as they keep lifting, I stop “correcting” completely – still less pain! I explain that there is no way I’ve corrected their scapular motion. Rather, I’ve changed how they feel - their sensitivity. Perhaps they became more confident, less fearful. Perhaps something happened in the brain (likely, but I don’t always get into it). I use that change as a learning tool and then use exercises to reinforce the new perception (a nice discussion can be found

## Manual skills in the diagnostic reasoning process

> Therefore, instead of considering manual examination findings only in terms T of how they should “guide” manual therapy interventions (i.e. this motion segmentP is perceived as I hypomobile by the clinician and/or painful by the patient, so mobilisation R is indicated), we propose that interpretation of manual examination findings C should be based upon a contemporary, multidimensional understanding of pain disorders S , and viewed as just one, albeit important, part of the information gathered during U an examination that considers N relative contributions from multiple dimensions to formulate an individualised treatment Aapproach. Indeed, rather than judging the M merit of clinical tests solely on their reliability, consideration of the findings from clinical tests in an integrated manner within clinical reasoning processes has been previously D advocated, particularly in complex, changeable E pain states.

"Manual examination reveals localised, heightened pressure sensitivity over the L1 spinous process"

> To eliminate manual examination from T the clinical evaluation would mean the loss of important data that can be usefully P interpreted in terms I of modern pain science -- muscle guarding!


> Empirical evidence has demonstrated that people want a physical examination (Parsons et al. , 2007), highlighted by a person with LBP in a study exploring the meaning of diagnostic tests (Rhodes et al. , 1999): T “And he still won’t examine me ...you’ve got to put your hands on P somebody...you I can’t fix a car just by looking at it”

> In addition to the aforementioned benefits of manual examination, C conducting a physical Sexamination may in part contribute to the perceivedU credibility of the clinician and help establish trust and a positive therapeutic alliance. N Ignoring patient preferences negatively impacts on the therapeutic relationship (Cooper A et al. , 2008, Parsons et al., 2007, Potter et al. , 2003). Thus we argue that in most clinical M cases a physical examination incorporating manual examination is appropriate. The use of manual therapy as a treatment technique D will be influenced by the specific presentation as demonstrated in the vignettes. However, E consideration of patient preferences T could also be taken into account as matching expectations is associated P with good functional outcomes (Kalauokalani et al., 2001). We suggest that where E manual therapy is used it should be applied alongside an honest C explanation of its short-term hypoalgesic effects whilst challenging any associated C biomedical beliefs. Matched home exercises should be employed to consciously move the Alocus of control to the person experiencing pain.

As always, talking about manual therapy specifically, it should be an adjunct treatment. Something that isn't performed with every patient. I don't think that touch generally *necessarily* needs to be, but it should be way more integrated into the underlying treatment philosophy, if it's a tool you have at your disposal.

It takes practice to be confident. Insecurity you feel will be transmitted through to the patient, and in this case where contextual effects are literally the entire game, it. This might be a great time to apply "fake it until you make it".

Manual therapy can be useful as an explanatory tool. It allows clinicians show patients how their pain is malleable when they otherwise might think it isn't, and provides a perfect opportunity to explain how this works, namely by changing sensitivity, which may be used as a launching off point to discuss how other activities and therapies modulate pain through changing sensitivity.

> manual therapy techniques are based on the physical Aproperties of the delivered stimulus (requiring M knowledge of anatomy, biomechanics and neurophysiology) as well as on the emotional properties that emerge from the sympathetic contact established with the patient. Manual therapists should develop relationship and communicative skills allowing this kind of touch to emerge. Recognition of the therapeutic value of C touch as one of the most qualifying professional acts of physiotherapists is needed and A guarantees patients of its best evidence-based delivering.



## Frontiers paper

> Touch in the clinical context forms part of a range of examination and therapeutic interventions such as manual therapy (Rondoni et al., 2017). It is also central to enhancing communication, patient compliance, cueing and assisting patients to reduce pain, and improving clinical outcomes. manual therapy techniques should be viewed as a vehicle to deliver touch effects, which can have a positive influence on the sense of “self,” wellbeing, and body image, as well as a profound calming and soothing influence on the individual.

Two broad categories: discriminative (Abeta fibers) and affective touch (c-tactile afferents, slow touch system... "affective touch is associated with tactile stimuli with a hedonic and often emotional component, encompassing aspects of reward and significance in social communications" )

primary function of the nervous system is to manage allostasis, i.e., predicting the physiological needs for survival

> The TA is centred around the tripartite elements of a working alliance described by Bordin (1979), including the agreement on goals, agreement on a task, and the development of attachment bonds, which are the foundation for a successful TA.

> A predictable and positive relationship between the HCP and a positive TA is considered more influential than individual attachment preferences, including any pre-existing anxieties when developing a new relationship with another individual (Taylor et al., 2015). In clinical practice, collaborative interpersonal relationships also contribute to patient control and self-efficacy by encouraging active participation and adherence to exercises (Babatunde et al., 2017; Kinney et al., 2018). Therefore, touch could help develop a successful collaborative and therapeutic relationship contributing to the good clinical benefits of a positive TA (Miciak et al., 2019)
