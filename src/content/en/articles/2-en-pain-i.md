Pain is a universal experience. More importantly, it's a deeply personal one. The meaning of pain varies from person to person and from culture to culture. No two people experience pain exactly the same, *even in the same situation.*

Official scientific definitions of pain are being updated constantly, but they still aren't great at capturing its essence, precisely because pain is so fluid. That being said, scientists in the last century have made incredible advances in the study of pain. By the end of this series you'll have a solid grasp of the most important and useful ideas.

Even though we know so much about pain, the way most people in society at large (including many healthcare professionals) think about and treat pain is still firmly rooted in ideas which originated hundreds, even thousands of years ago. So in order to get a clear picture of where we are now, we need to take a look back to see where we've come from.
