Pain is a universal experience, often unpleasant and distressing. It's also a deeply personal experience. The severity and significance of pain varies from context to context, person to person, and culture to culture. No two people experience pain exactly the same, even in the same situation!

Many theories and definitions of pain have been proposed throughout history, but even currently accepted scientific definitions aren't great at capturing its essence. Pain is fluid and hard to pin down, yet scientists in the last century have made incredible advances in its study. Today, we know a **lot** about what it is, how it arises, and how to treat it.

Despite the fact that we know so much about it, the way most people in society at large, including the majority of healthcare professionals, think about and manage pain is still firmly rooted in antiquated and disproven ideas.

## Cartesian model of pain

Ren√© Descartes was an highly influential French philosopher who lived in the 1600s. In fact, it is his philosophy which has informed many of western society's mainstream beliefs about pain.

Building on discoveries made by ancient Greek and Roman medical pioneers, Descartes postulated that experiences and responses to stimuli worked like a cord attached to a bell. In the same way you can pull the cord and the bell rings, stimuli from the environment pull on fibers in the body which attach to the brain and elicit responses.

Pain arises when the pull exerted on these fibers is sufficiently strong to sever them. In this view, pain is a phenomenon directly associated with physical damage to the body. Put another way,

**Hurt = Harm**

Descartes believed that

This is very simi as having a linear relationship with tissue damage. For him, **hurt = harm.** He believed that the mind (or soul) and the body were separated, and that there was a single "pain center" to where pain signals were sent whenever there was some sort of physical harm in the body. there was a single "pain center" in the brain (divorced from the body), where tissues would send pain signals to if there appeared

## The "pain gate"

In 1965, Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall shattered the Cartesian paradigm with their article *Pain mechanisms: a new theory*, now recognized to be one of the most influential scientific papers of all time. In this paper, they
