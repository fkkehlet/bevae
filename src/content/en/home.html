          <p>Hey there! I'm Frederik, a physiotherapy student at San Pablo University in Madrid, Spain. I love promoting health and helping people achieve their functional goals.</p>
          <p>For a large number of people in society, there's a very personal, often unpleasant sensation and emotion which intrudes on many aspects of their life: <strong>pain.</strong></p>
          <p>With a focus on pain as both a symptom and a condition in and of itself, my goal here is to develop a variety of free resources for clinicians, patients, and other curious people. I want to make it easy for everyone to make sense of this common yet misunderstood (and stigmatized) experience.</p>
