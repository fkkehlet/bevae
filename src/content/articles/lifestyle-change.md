Lifestyle plays a key role in the development and treatment of many conditions. Whether we're talking about non-specific pain, cancers, cardiovascular disorders, or any other chronic (or even acute) illness, a sizable chunk of the condition's etiology and severity is often directly attributable to modifiable lifestyle factors. Both from a scientific as well as a common-sense perspective, the way a person lives their life is an important factor in determining their health outcomes.

However, many clinicans feel that changing their patients' behavior is a colossal task. If they don't make changes *soon*, they're heading straight for  years, maybe even decades of great suffering and disability. They've got every reason in the world to do something about their current or future problem. And we're handing them the solutions on a silver platter! We have the knowledge, we have their best interests in mind...

**Why don't they just do what we say?**

 Let's unpack the answer to that question.



## What is lifestyle?

We'll need an operational definition of lifestyle in order to make sense of it:

*"The summation of a person's  **consistent behavioral patterns** (habits), deeply connected to their **identity."***

Identity can be loosely understood as the characteristics which define an individual and their sense of self, i.e., their interests, opinions, beliefs, values, and sense of place in the world.

**Behavior.** **Identity.** When we say lifestyle change, what we're really referring to is *behavior change + identity change.* You cannot sustain one without the other. The interaction between these two is *fundamental* to answering the question of how we best can help people change their lifestyle and alter the course of their future.

Where to start, then? If our goal is to change a behavior, we have to identify what drives that behavior.

*What [drives] behavior?*

There's synonym to "drives" we could drop in here. It's a word which encapsulates the reasons which underpin our behavior. In fact, there's a popular science book, *Drive,* which is entirely devoted to this word...



## Motivation

How many times have you heard, "he has low motivation," "she needs more motivation," or even, "we need to motivate our patients more?"

*Motivation* is a concept often described as a linear quantity. You just need more of it if you are to be successful in adhering to a behavior, and it's our job as clinicians to give high amounts of motivation to our patients.

This interpretation of motivation is tightly coupled with the binary *reward (the carrot) and punishment (the stick).* In order to increase motivation, we increase the degree of punishment or reward. It's elegant in its simplicity. But this simplicity is an illusion.

Many people in society still hold the belief that motivation works like this; however, we'll come to see that it's an untenable position to hold. This reductionist approach often backfires and results in poor outcomes and patient and clinician dissatisfaction. We have to reframe our idea of what motivation is and where it comes from if we want to be successful in helping our patients make sustainable lifestyle changes.

### Theories of motivation

The past century there have been various competing theories that have emerged from the field of motivational psychology. Some of these theories build directly on previous work, while others provide complementary perspectives. Each of the theories attempts to describe motivation from a slightly different angle. Humans are complex animals, and the reasons which ground our behaviors even more so.

We can split these theories of motivation into two broad categories: content theories, concerning *what* makes up motivational states, and process theories, *how* those motivational states arise.

#### Examples of content theories

- • Alderfer's ERG theory
- • Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory
- • Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- • McClelland's three needs theory

#### Examples of process theories

- • Adam's equity theory
- • Bandura's self-efficacy theory
- • Skinner's reinforcement theory
- • Vroom's expectancy theory



## Self-determination theory (SDT)

In this article we're going to focus on a macro-theory (a theory which itself is composed of several mini-theories) of motivation, *self-determination theory.* It emerged in the 1980s, and since psychologists Richard Ryan and Edward Deci formulated the first version of SDT, it has been the subject of intense development and research.

SDT has a massive body of literature supporting its application across a broad spectrum of contexts, from teaching in schools to coaching athletes, trauma counseling, leadership in the military, and beyond. If you're interested in the literature, *[check out the official website,](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org)* where all of the research on the theory to date is compiled and organized by topic.

### Humanistic origins

SDT has its origins in humanistic psychology, a branch of psychology which concerns itself with an individual's journey toward greater autonomy and self-actualization. At the heart of SDT lies this axiom:

*"...people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports." (selfdeterminationtheory.org)*

According to SDT, we naturally trend toward personal growth and integration of behaviors into our identity. Whether or not this natural tendency is expressed critically depends on our environment.

### Basic psychological needs

The question then becomes, what are the specific criteria in the environment which either support or thwart self-actualization? SDT defines three *basic psychological needs* which must be satisfied: **autonomy, competence, and relatedness.**

*"To the extent that the needs are ongoingly satisfied, people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness, but to the extent that they are thwarted, people will more likely evidence ill-being and non-optimal functioning." (selfdeterminationtheory.org)*

#### Autonomy

First up is autonomy, the desire to be the causal agents of our own actions. Irrespective of whether or not free will exists, SDT postulates that the subjective feeling of being in charge of your own choices and the feeling of psychological freedom this brings with it is necessary to be a healthy, functioning organism. Being self-motivated (*autonomous regulation*) leads to healthier outcomes compared to when we are told what to do (*controlled regulation*). We'll come back to and expand on the idea of "regulation" shortly.

#### Competence

When we choose to engage with a behavior, we seek a sense of control over the results of the behavior; we all want to experience mastery. Self-efficacy is a well known determinant of long-term patient outcomes, and supporting a person's feeling of competence increases and sustains their confidence in their own abilities.

#### Relatedness

Humans are social animals, and we have a deeply rooted desire for belonging and connection with other people. Relatedness includes your sense of place in the world, the feeling that others care about you, and the knowledge that you benefit those around you.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

SDT pioneered the idea that motivation can be described not only in terms of its quantity, but also its quality. **Intrinsic motivation** is the natural drive to seek out challenges. It derives from the enjoyment of and interest taken in the behavior itself. Intrinsic motivation is positively correlated with cognitive and social development, task performance, and well-being.

When the goal of a behavior is something other than the behavior itself, we're talking about **extrinsic motivation.** SDT expands on the concept of extrinsic motivation by delineating distinct subtypes, each defined by the quality of the behavior's *regulation.*

Extrinsic motivations are thus classified based on how *internalized* the behavior's regulation is. In other words, does the regulation of behavior (regulation here meaning the thing which is making you act out the behavior) come from outside, from within, or somewhere in between?

#### Types of extrinsic motivation

**External regulation** is the least autonomous kind of motivation. Behaving in accordance with known or predicted external punishment or reward are hallmarks of externally regulated behavior. Motivations characterized by external regulation have a clearly defined, externally perceived *locus of causality.* The individual's sense of volition and control over their actions is absent.

**Introjected regulation** is characterized by internal rewards and punishments. An introjection is an unconscious adoption of others' thoughts and attitudes. It's the voice in your head echoing external pressures. Pride, social status, and other ego-related motivations are examples of introjected regulation. Introjected regulation is more internalized than pure external regulation, but as it is not integrated with the self it is still characterized by an external locus of causality—it is still not "you" making the choice.

**Identified regulation** is the stage where self-determination gains a foothold. The locus of causality turns inward; the individual starts to value the behavior because it contributes to a personally relevant goal.

**Integrated regulation** is the most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation. The behavior is not only deemed valuable in terms of other outcomes, it is also integrated with other aspects of the self. While integrated regulation is still "extrinsic" because the desired outcome is not the behavior itself, it can exhibit similar qualities and benefits to intrinsic motivation.

### A spectrum of self-determination

Combining these concepts, we start to paint a picture of a continuum of motivation. One end represents extrinsic motivation in its most controlled form (external regulation), gradually becoming more and more self-determined until we arrive at integrated regulation and intrinsic motivation.

There's one more "type" of motivation we have not yet talked about. It lies outside of the continuum, beyond external regulation: *amotivation.* A person who is amotivated is totally indifferent and sees no point in pursuing the behavior in the first place. The behavior in question is entirely without regulation and the locus of causality is impersonal, neither external nor internal.

Amotivation aside (we'll return to it later), the crux of SDT follows from its root axiom. We will naturally integrate new experiences into our sense of self provided that the environment supports our basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

As the motivations grounding our behavior shift from being characterized by externally "controlled" regulation to internally "autonomous" regulation, a number of positive side effects emerge. Our task performance and activity engagement improves. We are more persistent in the face of obstacles and setbacks. We turn into happier, more confident, better functioning people.

#### The marathon runner

A natural consequence of SDT is that there is rarely only one kind of motivation behind a behavior. We'll illustrate this with a thought experiment. Imagine that you just finished a marathon. What motivated you to train and participate in the race?

At the end of the race, there are likely free food and drinks. Perhaps you'll be given a physical medal contingent on your performance. If those were the only reasons you had to train and run in the marathon, you probably wouldn't have followed through with it (external regulation).

The medal you were chasing could also represent an internal pressure to beat your personal record. Maybe your parents pressured you to perform well in sports when you were a kid. Those thoughts could well have stayed with you as an introjection. Or you saw the race as a way to elevate your status in your  social circle by beating your friends' race times (introjected regulation).

The desire to run this marathon and get a medal could also be tied to your personal goal of eventually running a sub-3 hour marathon. This was a stepping stone to achieving that (identified regulation).

You see yourself as an "fit person" and a "competitive athlete." Running marathons and beating the competition constitutes a part of this identity (integrated regulation).

Finally, you enjoy running and racing for the sake of it. It's not only about training to outrun zombies in case there's an apocalypse, it *just feels good* to run long distances as fast as you can (intrinsic motivation).

Ask those around you at the finish line and each participant will point to different reasons to justify their decision to participate. Each of these reasons will occupy a different sized slice of their total motivation profile (think of a pie chart).

Some people's decision to participate may have been dominated by external and introjected regulation, while others may be so intrinsically motivated by the enjoyment of running long distances that that was why they signed up.



## Implications for clinical practice

We've seen how different motivations might fit together to result in a behavior depending on the relative dominance of those motivations. We've also learned that over time, movement toward integrated regulation is a natural process given the right conditions. Let's take a step back and revisit the question we asked ourselves at the start.

**Why don't they just do what we say?**

We're now in a position to see how the *premise of the question itself* is holding us back.

Telling people what to do, threatening them with future consequences, or even promising external reward is the *worst* kind of motivation one can have. An approach informed by motivational psychology suggests that we should not attempt to motivate our patients in this way. We should instead create an environment which is supportive of our patients' basic psychological needs.

### Manipulate the clinical context

The *clinical context* encapsulates the environment surrounding the clinician-patient interaction. From the clinic's physical setup to our body language, everything we do and say either facilitates or hinders an environment where our patients' autonomy, competence, and relatedness can thrive.

Even though we should not motivate someone by telling them what to do, we still have the potential to make a profound impact on shaping healthy behavioral patterns by facilitating their integration into the person's identity.

### Be a lifestyle coach

The most profound conclusion we can draw from SDT encourages us to rethink the entire foundation of our practice:

**Clinicians should not decide conclusions for their patients, patients should come to conclusions for themselves.**

It may seem pedantic at first glance, but the implications are vast.

First and foremost, it demands a change in mindset: stop taking on a parental role when treating patients. You are now their *lifestyle coach.* You help your patients achieve their goals, but you do not get to decide their goals for them. You want the best for them, but you do not make decisions on their behalf.

Secondly, trust and empathy always comes first. Every aspect of clinical practice is suffused by a strong therapeutic alliance. You work together as a team. There should be no hierarchical difference between you and the patient of which to speak. Everything else follows.

### Amotivated, or conflicted?

If a person is amotivated when it comes to changing a specific behavior, there is nothing you can do. A person must be at least *somewhat* willing to change if they are to have any hope at all in succeeding. However, when you dig beneath the surface, most people are not truly amotivated when it comes to becoming healthier.

A patient might have conflicting motivations, negative previous experiences, or an unsupportive environment. They might be unsure of their own values and life goals. This complex internal struggle can then masquerade as indifference. It's your job as a lifestyle coach to pull these conflicting emotions out of your patients, lay them out on the table, and start to help them put together the jigsaw puzzle of their life.

It cannot be overstated how essential trust and empathy are during this process. Without a strong therapeutic alliance, there is very little chance your patients will open up and be honest with you. It takes good communication and critical reasoning skills to navigate a person's internal landscape.

### Motivational interviewing (MI)

*Motivational interviewing* is a therapeutic technique which was developed specifically to tackle behavior change. It has its roots in addiction counseling, but MI has since been applied successfully in many other contexts, similar to SDT. Some people working on MI have even looked to SDT to explain why it works.

Although we won't dive deep into how to do MI in this article, we've actually already covered a fair number of concepts which are relevant to the technique. Reflecting questions back to the patient to help them come to conclusions for themselves (autonomy), focusing on past successes to build self-efficacy (competence), and listening in an active and empathetic way (relatedness)—these are all fundamental to doing MI well.

#### The decision matrix

We'll finish up by introducing a tool that you can use in the clinic to implement some of the concepts we've discussed here. An activity which is sometimes done in MI is making a *decision matrix.* It's an activity you can do with your patients to increase the chance that they will commit to a behavior change when they might initially feel conflicted.

Making a decision matrix consists of drawing a 2x2 table (the so-called "matrix"). The patient then fills out the benefits (1) and drawbacks (2) of either continuing with the status quo (3) or making a change (4).

During the course of this activity, the patient comes to terms with the exact reasons why they are (or are not) behaving in a certain way. You should actively try to highlight discrepencies between the patient's values and their current actions. You should also bring attention to previous situations where they have been successful in accomplishing difficult tasks in order to build their self-efficacy.

This does not imply that you at any point tell them what to do or what to think. By having patients connect with their own values and figure out what kind of person they want to be, you can get them moving on the path to autonomous regulation of healthy behavior. 



## Summary

In this article we began with a seemingly innocuous question:

 **"Why don't patients just do what we say?"**

To answer this question, we first gave a concrete definition to lifestyle, recognizing that the identities connected with lifestyle behaviors are just as important as the behaviors themselves.

Self-determination theory showed us that the reasons underpinning our behavior can be extremely complex. It gave us a framework to identify and categorize different kinds of motivation, as well as some guiding principles of how to help patients express their natural proclivity to autonomously regulate and integrate new experiences into their sense of self.

We discovered that the question posed at the beginning was actually loaded with unhelpful assumptions. We had to critically deconstruct our clinical practice in order to be able to better support our patients' basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

We introduced motivational interviewing, an evidence-based counseling technique designed to facilitate behavior change where there is ambivalence. We learned how to make and use a decision matrix, an activity which can aid patients in committing to a lifestyle change by relating the benefits and drawbacks of doing so to their personal goals and values.

Thank you for reading this article! I had a lot of fun writing it. I hope that the ideas I have presented here will be as useful to you as they have been to me.
