Lifestyle plays a critical role in the development and treatment of many conditions, from nonspecific pain to cardiovascular and respiratory disorders.  Whether we're talking about non-specific pain, cancers, cardiovascular disorders, etc., a sizable chunk of the condition's etiology is likely directly attributable to modifiable lifestyle factors.

Both from a scientific as well as a common-sense perspective, the way a person spends the majority of their days is key in determining the course of their outcomes; however, many clinicans feel that changing their patients' behavior is a colossal task.

We have their best interests in mind and we know what's best for them. And if they don't make changes *now*, they're diving head-first into years, maybe even decades of great suffering and disability.

*Why don't they just do what we say?*

Let's unpack the answer to this question.



## Defining lifestyle

We need an operational definition of lifestyle in order to make sense of it:

*"The summation of a person's  **consistent behavioral patterns** (habits), deeply connected to their **identity."***

Identity can be loosely understood as the characteristics which define an individual and their sense of self, i.e., their interests, opinions, beliefs, values, and sense of place in the world.

**Behavior.** **Identity.** When we say lifestyle change, what we're really referring to is *behavior change + identity change.* You cannot sustain one without the other. The interaction between these two is *fundamental* to answering the question of how we best can help people change their lifestyle and alter the course of their future.

Where to start, then? Well, if our goal is to change behavior (and identity), it's necessary to identify what drives that behavior.

*What [drives] behavior?*

There's a word we can drop in here, in place of "drives," which has a similar meaning. In fact, there's a popular science book, *Drive,* which is entirely devoted to this word! It's a word which encapsulates the reasons which underpin our behavior...



## Motivation

How many times have you heard, "he has low motivation," "she needs more motivation," or even, "we need to motivate our patients more?"

*Motivation* is a concept often described as a linear quantity. You just need more of it if you are to be successful in adhering to a behavior, and it's our job as clinicians to increase our patients' motivation.

This reductionist take on motivation is tightly coupled with the binary, *reward (the carrot) and punishment (the stick).* In order to increase motivation, we increase the degree of punishment or reward. It's elegant in its simplicity. But this simplicity is an illusion.

Many people in society still hold the belief that motivation works in this way. But we'll soon see that it's an untenable position to hold. This approach often backfires and results in unhappiness and *worse* motivation. We have to reframe our idea of what motivation is and where it comes from if we want to be successful in helping our patients make sustainable, long-lasting lifestyle changes.

### Theories of motivation

The past century there have been various competing theories that have emerged from the field of motivational psychology. Some of these theories build directly on previous work, while others provide complementary perspectives. Each of the theories attempts to analyze motivation from a slightly different angle. Humans are complex animals, and the reasons which ground our behaviors even more so.

We can split these theories of motivation into two broad categories - content theories, concerning the content of motivational states (AKA *what* are the motivations), and process theories, *how* motivations arise. There are also a number of cognitive theories which integrate motivation.

#### Examples of content theories

- • Achievement motivation theory
- • Alderfer's ERG theory
- • Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory
- • Maslow's hierarchy of needs

#### Examples of process theories

- • Adam's equity theory
- • Goal-setting theory
- • Reinforcement theory
- • Vroom's expectancy theory



## Self-determination theory (SDT)

In this article we're going to focus on one content theory in particular, *self-determination theory,* which emerged in the 1980s. Since Richard Ryan and Edward Deci formulated its first version, SDT has been the subject of intense development and research.

SDT has a massive body of literature supporting its application across a broad spectrum of contexts, from teaching in schools, coaching athletes, addiction and trauma counselling, military and civilian workplace leadership, and beyond. If you're interested in the literature, *[the official website](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org)* has them all organized in one place.

SDT is a macro (high level) theory which stems from one core assumption:

*"...people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports."*

So we have a natural tendency towards growth, but whether or not that natural tendency is expressed critically depends on our environment. The environment is a determining factor in whether or not the person actively engages with whatever behavior it is we're analyzing. 

### Basic psychological needs

The question then becomes, what are the specific criteria in the environment which support or thwart this natural tendency to grow and integrate new experiences into the self? SDT formulates this in terms of three basic psychological needs: **autonomy, competence, and relatedness.**

*"To the extent that the needs are ongoingly satisfied, people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness, but to the extent that they are thwarted, people will more likely evidence ill-being and non-optimal functioning."*

#### Autonomy

Desire to be causal agents of one's own life and act in harmony with one's integrated self; however, note this does not mean to be independent of others, but rather constitutes a feeling of overall psychological liberty and freedom of internal will. When a person is autonomously motivated their performance, wellness, and engagement is heightened rather than if a person is told what to do (a.k.a. control motivation).

#### Competence

Seek to control the outcome and experience mastery.

#### Relatedness

Will to interact with, be connected to, and experience caring for others.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

SDT pioneered the idea that motivation can be described in terms of its quality, not just its quantity. **Intrinsic motivation** is the natural drive to seek out challenges. This kind of motivation derives from the enjoyment and interest taken in the behavior itself rather than externally determined outcomes. It is positively associated with cognitive and social development.

When a goal of a behavior is something other than the behavior itself, we're talking about **extrinsic motivation.** SDT expands on this to delineate distinct forms of extrinsic motivation, defined by the quality of the motivation's *regulation.* These subtypes fall along a continuum of *internalization,* described below. As the person moves from externally regulated to internally regulated motivations, their autonomy increases.

#### Regulation of extrinsic motivation

**External regulation** is the least autonomous. Known or predicted external punishment or reward characterize this kind of extrinsic motivation. Motivations characterized by external regulation have a clearly defined externally perceived *locus of causality.*

**Introjected regulation** is more internal, but it still has a somewhat externally perceived locus of causality and it has not been integrated with the self. Thus, this type of extrinsic motivation is not considered self-determined. Ego-related motivations (self-worth, pride, social status, etc.) are examples of introjected regulation.

**Identified regulation** is the stage at which self-determination starts to gain a foothold, and the locus of causality starts to turn inward. The person identifies with the value of the behavior as a result of its contribution to a personally relevant goal.

**Integrated regulation** is the most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation. The behavior is not only seen as instrumental and valuable in terms of other outcomes, but it is integrated with other aspects of the self. It shares qualities with intrinsic motivation, but it is still extrinsic because it is not the inherent enjoyment or interest in the behavior which is the goal.

### The spectrum of motivation

Combining the above concepts, we start to paint a picture of a spectrum of motivation, where one end represents extrinsic motivation in its most extreme form (external regulation), gradually becoming more and more self-determined until we arrive at integration with the self and eventually total intrinsic motivation.

And as we alluded to at the beginning of this section, the crux of the theory lies in the assumption (a very well supported assumption) that we have a natural tendency to move along this spectrum. We will naturally integrate behaviors into our sense of self provided that the environment supports our basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

A key point to keep in mind is that for any given behavior there is usually not only one kind of motivation underpinning it. To illustrate this, let's take the example of a marathon race.

At the end of the race, there will be free food and drinks, and perhaps a physical medal (external regulation). The medal also represents any potential ego-driven reasons, such as the sense of pride you feel at beating your competitors (introjected regulation). Maybe you have a personal goal of running a sub-3 hour race (identified regulation). You see running as a part of your self, and you participate in social circles And finally, and most importantly, you *just enjoy running.* It makes you feel great!

For any given person participating in the marathon, the relative proportion of each of these motivations will vary.


it's a safe to assume that this represents maybe 5% of a person's total motivation *at best* of a person's motivation to run a marathon, if at all. There may be some inherent enjoyment (intrinsic motivation), 


gradually transforms into intrinsic regulation, gradually Putting the above concepts together, 

More intrinsic = more persistence

People can have a mix of different kinds of motivation

And the way we start to travel





We as clinicians should not try to force motivation. Instead, we should support the person's sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

### Self-efficacy and the "internal environment"



### Intrinsic vs. extrinsic

A key concept which SDT has popularized is the idea that motivation doesn't just exist 



### The spectrum of motivation

In SDT's view of motivation, we can put







## Extra

Before we take the plunge into the psychological theory of motivation and how to apply it, I briefly want to return to a word I mentioned just before - *"modifiable."*

There's always *something* the patient can change, even if they aren't able to see it as clearly as we can. 

MINDSET:
We see from a perspective, like giving advice to friends. We can become stuck. So if we want to help people change their behavior, we have to understand what makes people change their behavior. How to be good coaches. This is the mindset we need to have, the approach we must take if we want to have the highest chance of success - we *cannot* change a person's behaviors for them, and we *cannot* motivate them to change.
Lifestyle coaches



So much of long-term success hinges on lifestyle change. This falls in the realm of behavioral psychology, and today, I want to explore a key element at the very core of behavior. What might that be?


We'll spend the first half of class learning about a theory of motivation known as self-determination theory, and we'll spend the second half of class learning about a counselling technique called motivational interviewing, which adheres to the principles of SDT and can be used to help coach people to change their behavior.

The trick is to find out how to help people motivate themselves... we can't motivate them! Very poor. *present idea before*



"The patient needs to *be motivated*"
