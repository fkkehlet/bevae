Lifestyle plays a critical role in the development and treatment of many conditions, from nonspecific pain to cardiovascular and respiratory disorders.  Whether we're talking about non-specific pain, cancers, cardiovascular disorders, etc., a sizable chunk of the condition's etiology is likely directly attributable to modifiable lifestyle factors.

Both from a scientific as well as a common-sense perspective, the way a person spends the majority of their days is key in determining the course of their outcomes; however, many clinicans feel that changing their patients' behavior is a colossal task.

We have their best interests in mind and we know what's best for them. And if they don't make changes *now*, they're diving head-first into years, maybe even decades of great suffering and disability.

**Why don't they just do what we say?**

Let's unpack the answer to this question.



## What is lifestyle?

We need an operational definition of lifestyle in order to make sense of it:

*"The summation of a person's  **consistent behavioral patterns** (habits), deeply connected to their **identity."***

Identity can be loosely understood as the characteristics which define an individual and their sense of self, i.e., their interests, opinions, beliefs, values, and sense of place in the world.

**Behavior.** **Identity.** When we say lifestyle change, what we're really referring to is *behavior change + identity change.* You cannot sustain one without the other. The interaction between these two is *fundamental* to answering the question of how we best can help people change their lifestyle and alter the course of their future.

Where to start, then? Well, if our goal is to change behavior (and identity), it's necessary to identify what drives that behavior.

*What [drives] behavior?*

There's a word we can drop in here, in place of "drives," which has a similar meaning. In fact, there's a popular science book, *Drive,* which is entirely devoted to this word! It's a word which encapsulates the reasons which underpin our behavior...



## Motivation

How many times have you heard, "he has low motivation," "she needs more motivation," or even, "we need to motivate our patients more?"

*Motivation* is a concept often described as a linear quantity. You just need more of it if you are to be successful in adhering to a behavior, and it's our job as clinicians to increase our patients' motivation.

This reductionist take on motivation is tightly coupled with the binary, *reward (the carrot) and punishment (the stick).* In order to increase motivation, we increase the degree of punishment or reward. It's elegant in its simplicity. But this simplicity is an illusion.

Many people in society still hold the belief that motivation works in this way; however, we'll soon see that it's an untenable position to hold. This approach often backfires and results in unhappiness and worse outcomes. We have to reframe our idea of what motivation is and where it comes from if we want to be successful in helping our patients make sustainable lifestyle changes.

### Theories of motivation

The past century there have been various competing theories that have emerged from the field of motivational psychology. Some of these theories build directly on previous work, while others provide complementary perspectives. Each of the theories attempts to analyze motivation from a slightly different angle. Humans are complex animals, and the reasons which ground our behaviors even more so.

We can split these theories of motivation into two broad categories - content theories, concerning the content of motivational states (AKA *what* are the motivations), and process theories, *how* motivations arise. There are also a number of cognitive theories which integrate motivation.

#### Examples of content theories

- • Alderfer's ERG theory
- • Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory
- • Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- • McClelland's three needs theory

#### Examples of process theories

- • Adam's equity theory
- • Bandura's self-efficacy theory
- • Skinner's reinforcement theory
- • Vroom's expectancy theory



## Self-determination theory (SDT)

In this article we're going to focus on a macro-theory (a theory which itself contains several mini-theories), *self-determination theory.* SDT emerged in the 1980s. Since Richard Ryan and Edward Deci formulated its first version, it has been the subject of intense development and research.

SDT has a massive body of literature supporting its application across a broad spectrum of contexts, from teaching in schools, coaching athletes, addiction and trauma counselling, military and civilian workplace leadership, and beyond. If you're interested in the literature, *[the official website](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org)* has the research organized all in one place.

### Humanistic origins

SDT has its origins in humanistic psychology, which concerns itself with the personal journey towards self-efficacy and self-actualization. At the heart of SDT is one axiom:

*"...people are active organisms, with evolved tendencies toward growing, mastering ambient challenges, and integrating new experiences into a coherent sense of self. These natural developmental tendencies do not, however, operate automatically, but instead require ongoing social nutriments and supports."*

According to SDT, we naturally trend toward growth, integrating new experiences into our identity. Whether or not this natural tendency is expressed critically depends on our environment.

### Basic psychological needs

The question then becomes, what are the specific criteria in the environment which support or thwart this natural tendency to grow and integrate new experiences into the self? SDT defines three *basic psychological needs* which must be satisfied: **autonomy, competence, and relatedness.**

*"To the extent that the needs are ongoingly satisfied, people will develop and function effectively and experience wellness, but to the extent that they are thwarted, people will more likely evidence ill-being and non-optimal functioning."*

#### Autonomy

First up, autonomy. The desire to be causal agents of our own life. We are not entering the philosophical debate on the existence of free will, but SDT postulates that making our own choices, and the the feeling of psychological freedom this brings with it, is crucial to happiness and self-actualization.

When we are autonomously motivated (internal regulation), our wellness, engagement, and persistence is higher compared to when we are told what to do (external regulation). We'll come back to and expand on the concept of "regulation" shortly.

#### Competence

There's a need to feel a sense of control over the outcomes of your behaviors. We all want to be good at what we do, to experience mastery. Self-efficacy is a well known determining when looking at long-term patient outcomes, and it's clear that supporting a person's sense of competence is necessary for them to increase and sustain confidence in their own abilities.

#### Relatedness

Humans are social animals, and we have a deep evolutionary need for a sense of belonging and connnection with others. Relatedness involves not only others caring for you—equally as important is your own sense of place in the world and the feeling that YOU matter to others.

### Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

SDT pioneered the idea that motivation can be described not only in terms of its quantity, but also its quality. **Intrinsic motivation** is the natural drive to seek out challenges. It derives from the enjoyment of and interest taken in the behavior itself, rather than from externally determined goals. Intrinsic motivation is positively correlated with cognitive and social development, task performance, and well-being.

When the goal of a behavior is something other than the behavior itself, we're talking about **extrinsic motivation.** SDT expands on the idea of extrinsic motivation to delineate distinct subtypes, defined by the quality of the behavior's *regulation.*

Extrinsic motivations are classified based on their degree of *internalization.* In other words, does the regulation of behavior come from outside (external regulation), from within (integrated regulation), or somewhere in between?

#### Types of extrinsic motivation

**External regulation** is the least autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation. Behaving in accordance with known or predicted external punishment or reward are hallmarks of externally regulated behavior. Motivations characterized by external regulation have a clearly defined, externally perceived *locus of causality.* The individual's sense of volition and control over their actions is absent.

**Introjected regulation** is more internalized, but it still has a somewhat externally perceived locus of causality and it has not been integrated with the self. Thus, this type of extrinsic motivation is not considered self-determined. Ego-related motivations (self-worth, pride, social status, etc.), i.e., internal rewards and punishments, are examples of introjected regulation.

**Identified regulation** is the stage at which self-determination starts to gain a foothold, and the locus of causality starts to turn inward. The person identifies with the value of the behavior as a result of its contribution to a personally relevant goal.

**Integrated regulation** is the most autonomous kind of extrinsic motivation. The behavior is not only seen as instrumental and valuable in terms of other outcomes, but it is integrated with other aspects of the self. It shares qualities with intrinsic motivation, but it is still extrinsic because it is not the inherent enjoyment or interest in the behavior which is the goal.

### A spectrum of self-determination

Combining these concepts, we start to paint a picture of a continuum of motivation, where one end represents extrinsic motivation in its most extreme form (external regulation), gradually becoming more and more self-determined until we arrive at integration with the self and eventually total intrinsic motivation.

There's one more "type" of motivation we have not yet talked about. It lies outside of the continuum, beyond external regulation: amotivation. A person who is amotivated is totally indifferent and sees no point in pursuing the behavior in the first place. The behavior in question is entirely without regulation, and the locus of causality is *impersonal* (neither external nor internal).

Amotivation aside (we'll return to it later), the crux of SDT follows from the axiom we introduced earlier. We will naturally integrate behaviors into our sense of self provided that the environment supports our basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. As the motivations for our behavior shift from being characterized by external regulation to internal regulation, performance, autonomy, engagement, persistence, and well-being improve.

A consequence of the "continuum" interpretation of motivation is that for any given behavior there is very rarely only one kind of motivation behind it. Let's illustrate this with a concrete example.

#### Case study: marathon runner

Imagine that you just finished a marathon. What motivated you to train and participate in the race?

At the end of the race, there are likely free food and drinks. Perhaps you'll be given a physical medal contingent on your performance. If those were the only reasons you had to train and run in the marathon, you probably wouldn't have followed through with it (external regulation).

The medal you were chasing could also represent an internal pressure to beat your last race time. Or maybe you saw the race as a way to elevate your status in your social circle by beating your friends' race times (introjected regulation).

The desire to run a marathon could also be tied to a personal goal. Maybe you have a long-term goal of participating in an ultramarathon, and racing marathons is itself a part of training for that (identified regulation).

You see yourself as an "athlete" and a "healthy person." Running marathons forms an important aspect of these identities for you (integrated regulation).

Finally, you enjoy running and racing for the sake of it. It's not only about beating your last time or wanting to age well, it *just feels good* (intrinsic motivation).

Every marathon participant will have different reasons behind their decision to participate. Each of these reasons will also occupy a variable portion of the "total motivation" for the behavior. Some people's motivations may be characterized by the domination of external regulation, while others may be so intrinsically motivated by running long distances that this constitutes the majority of the reason they decide to sign up.



## Implications for practice

We've seen how different motivations might fit together to result in a behavior depending on the relative dominance of those motivations. We've also learned that over time, movement toward integrated regulation is a natural process given the right conditions. Let's take a step back and revisit the question we asked ourselves at the start.

**Why don't they just do what we say?**

We're now in a position to see how the *premise of the question itself* is holding us back.

Telling people what to do, threatening them with future consequences, or even promising external reward is the *worst* kind of motivation one can have. An approach informed by motivational psychology suggests that we should not attempt to motivate our patients in this way. We should instead create an environment which is supportive of our patients' basic psychological needs.

### Clinical context

The *clinical context* encapsulates the environment surrounding the clinician-patient interaction. From the clinic's physical setup to our body language, everything we do and say either facilitates or hinders an environment where our patients' autonomy, competence, and relatedness can thrive.

Even though we should not motivate someone by telling them what to do, we still have the potential to make a profound impact on shaping healthy behavioral patterns by facilitating their integration into the person's identity.

### Lifestyle coaching

The most profound conclusion we can draw from SDT encourages us to rethink the entire foundation of our practice:

**Clinicians should not decide conclusions for their patients, patients should come to conclusions for themselves.**

It may seem pedantic at first glance, but the implications are vast.

First and foremost, it demands a change in mindset: stop taking on a parental role when treating patients. You are now their *lifestyle coach.* You help your patients achieve their goals, but you do not get to decide their goals for them. You want the best for them, but you do not make decisions on their behalf.

Secondly, trust and empathy always comes first. Every aspect of clinical practice is suffused by a strong therapeutic alliance. You work together as a team. There should be no hierarchical difference between you and the patient of which to speak. Everything else follows.

### Amotivated, or conflicted?

If a person is amotivated when it comes to changing a specific behavior, there is nothing you can do. A person must be at least *somewhat* willing to change if they are to have any hope at all in succeeding. However, when you dig beneath the surface, most people are not truly amotivated when it comes to becoming healthier.

A patient might have conflicting motivations, negative previous experiences, or an unsupportive environment. They might be unsure of their own values and life goals. This complex internal struggle can then masquerade as indifference. It's your job as a lifestyle coach to pull these conflicting emotions out of your patients, lay them out on the table, and start to help them put together the jigsaw puzzle of their life.

It cannot be overstated how essential trust and empathy are during this process. Without a strong therapeutic alliance, there is very little chance your patients will open up and be honest with you. It takes good communication and critical reasoning skills to help a person navigate the internal landscape of their life.

### The decision matrix

There are countless books and psychological theories which can help


highlight, how our patients' values conflict with their current lifestyle and habits.


On the one hand, they have various motivations which are driving their current behavior. But there's an internal struggle, as they also what do you do if a patient has conflicting emotions regarding a lifestyle intervention? 

So what if the patients' goals or? Depending on their state of "readiness,"



## Extra

Returning to the example of a marathon runner...

(guided by our professional knowledge)

we will have a lot more success in "motivating them" to change their damaging behavior. how their values and their current lifestyle

Bringing the theory back to the question we explore at the start

we want to change someone's lifestyle, identifying what motivations lie behind the different behaviors which compose a person's lifestyle is n to moving towards a healthier

Self-efficacy and the "internal environment"

Before we take the plunge into the psychological theory of motivation and how to apply it, I briefly want to return to a word I mentioned just before - *"modifiable."*

There's always *something* the patient can change, even if they aren't able to see it as clearly as we can. 

MINDSET:
We see from a perspective, like giving advice to friends. We can become stuck. So if we want to help people change their behavior, we have to understand what makes people change their behavior. How to be good coaches. This is the mindset we need to have, the approach we must take if we want to have the highest chance of success - we *cannot* change a person's behaviors for them, and we *cannot* motivate them to change.
Lifestyle coaches

So much of long-term success hinges on lifestyle change. This falls in the realm of behavioral psychology, and today, I want to explore a key element at the very core of behavior. What might that be?

We'll spend the first half of class learning about a theory of motivation known as self-determination theory, and we'll spend the second half of class learning about a counselling technique called motivational interviewing, which adheres to the principles of SDT and can be used to help coach people to change their behavior.

The trick is to find out how to help people motivate themselves... we can't motivate them! Very poor. *present idea before*

"The patient needs to *be motivated*"
